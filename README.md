#### Request Your Own!

To request your own, follow these simple steps:

1. Create an issue, the **title** must be the same as your Github account.
2. The **comment** must specify *halloween*, *standard* or *christmas* to show the type of avatar you want. You can pick multiple. 
3. Your Github profile picture is used for *inspiration*, if you would prefer me to use another, please add it to the comment.
4. Anyother instructions, `I want to be a chicken!`, please add to the comment.

I am aiming to do one per day, so please be patient.
